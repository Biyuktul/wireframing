# Wireframing
## Explanation
- Wireframing is a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or an app.
-- it doesn't delve in to detailed design it only focues on the placment of ui elements, navigation flow, and overall ui structure.
## Importance
- Clarifies ideas & concepts
- Facilitates communication between stakeholders
- Guides the design process
- focuses on functionality and UX

## Key Elements in a Wireframe
- Layout Structure: Defines the basic layout and arrangement of content and interface elements (e.g., header, sidebar, main content area).
- Navigation: How users navigate between different sections or pages. a navbar at top of a page.
- Content Placment: Represents where contents like text, images, or videos will be placed. (e.g. showing a placeholders or dummy content.)
- Functionality: Indicates interactive elements like buttons, menus, sliders, or forms, showing how users will interact with the interface.

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity
- Basic layout sketches with minimal detail.
- Used early in design for quick planning and feedback.
- Focuses on structure, not visuals.

### High-Fidelity
- Detailed mockups close to the final design.
- Used later for client reviews and developer handoff.
- Includes real content, spacing, and interactions.

## Wireframe Type Used

This project uses a **High-Fidelity Wireframe** to outline structure and navigation with detailed visuals.

## Wireframing Tools

**Figma** (Recommended): A web-based tool great for wireframing and real-time collaboration.  
Other tools: Balsamiq (low-fidelity), Adobe XD, Sketch, Lucidchart.

Figma is preferred for its simplicity, teamwork features, and reusable components.
